<h3 id="steps-to-submit-assignments-via-github-canvas">Steps to submit assignments via GitHub+Canvas</h3>
<ol>
<li>Make a subfolder in <em>your</em> GitHub repository (not the class respository!) named after the assignment (i.e. {yourusername}/{course}/{assignment}, etc.)</li>
<li>Commit all parts of your assignment (i.e. code+documentation file) into that subfolder</li>
<li>Submit the link <strong>to that folder</strong> in the appropriate Canvas assignment by the deadline</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="documentation-file-outline">Documentation File outline</h3>
<ul>
<li>The documentation file (<strong>always</strong> in Markdown, saved as a .md file) must have the following:<ul>
<li>what you did</li>
<li>how you did it</li>
<li>the problems you faced (ABDYD: always be documenting your debugging!)</li>
<li>how you overcame them</li>
<li><em>what code you used from others/elsewhere</em><ul>
<li>where to find that code (specific links!!!)</li>
<li>other folks&#39; GitHub public repositories, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack OverFlow</a>, language forums are the best places to go for help most of the time</li>
<li><em>do not</em> submit paywalled links</li>
<li><em>if</em> you submit YouTube links (which is discouraged), they must have TIME STAMPS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Correctly document all your debugging, especially if you code ultimately does not run as intended. I will take points off for code that does not run correctly, but will still give partial credit if it is well-documented.</li>
<li>For the purposes of this class, your documentation file also helps you prepare to talk about your code in class with your colleagues.</li>
<li>In general (unless I specify otherwise), it is permissible to use chat-GPT or other large-language models under the following circumstances:<ul>
<li>You document the ENTIRE INTERACTION with screenshots and include images of those screen shots with your documentation.</li>
<li>You write out <em>in your own words</em> your <strong>SPECIFIC</strong> understanding of what you learned from using chat-GPT in your documentation file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
